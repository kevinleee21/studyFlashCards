# Java Arrays 
- [[An **array** is a collection of variables of the same type]], referred to
  by a common name.
- In Java, arrays are objects, and must be created dynamically (at runtime). [[Which continent is known as the "Roof of the World"?:::Asia.***Hard]]

## Declaring an Array
- [[General Form:
arrayName;]]
- ex: int[] myData;
- [[Which country is the largest in terms of land area?:::The largest country is Russia.***Hard]]

- The above only creates a reference to an array object, but no array has
  actually been created yet.
- [[What is the largest lake in Africa? ::: The largest lake is Lake Victoria.***Hard]]
- [[Which country is located in both Europe and Asia?:::Russia.***Hard]]

[[What is the official language of Japan?:::
The official language is Japanese.***Hard]]

## Creating an Array (Instantiation)
- [[General form:  arrayName = new type[numberOfElements].]]
- ex: myData = new int[100];
- [[Which city is located on two continents?::: 
Istanbul, Turkey. It is located on both Europe and Asia.***Hard]]


- Data types of the reference and array need to match.
- [[numberOfElements must be a positive Integer.]]
- [[Gotcha: Array size is not modifiable once instantiated. ]]
